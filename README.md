# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexis

🎓 Future work-study student at **Epitech**

💻 Self-taught and passionate about **web/mobile development** and **software engineering**. I’m just getting started in the tech world, but I’ve already developed strong skills, especially in back-end development.


## 🚀 About Me

I'm someone who's always curious and eager to learn. I’m driven by a desire to turn my passion for code into a full-blown career. Every day, I try to take one more step toward that goal.

Outside of programming:
- 🤔 I love discussing the future and evolution of technology
- 🧠 I'm always learning new things, tech-related or not
- 🏋️ I enjoy sports and staying active

These interests help me grow both as a developer and as a person. I truly believe that understanding the world around us makes us better at building tech for it.
